# Project Statement: House Price Prediction System

---

##  Project Title
**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

---

##  Problem Statement

In the real estate market, determining accurate house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents. Manual price estimation based on various factors can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. There is a need for an automated, data-driven solution that can predict house prices based on key property features.

### Key Challenges:
- **Inconsistent pricing**: Different agents may value similar properties differently
- **Multiple variables**: House prices depend on various factors (size, location, rooms, etc.)
- **Market complexity**: Understanding how different features contribute to price
- **Time efficiency**: Manual evaluation is slow and resource-intensive

---

##  Solution Overview

This project develops a **machine learning-based house price prediction system** using Linear Regression to provide accurate, consistent, and fast price estimates based on property characteristics.

### Core Features:
- Predicts house prices using three key features: square footage, number of rooms, and location
- Handles both numerical and categorical data seamlessly
- Provides quantifiable accuracy metrics
- Visualizes prediction performance
- Easily extensible for additional features

---

##  Objectives

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Build a predictive model** that accurately estimates house prices based on input features
2. **Handle categorical data** (locations) using appropriate encoding techniques
3. **Evaluate model performance** using standard machine learning metrics
4. **Provide interpretable results** through visualization and example predictions

### Secondary Objectives:
1. Demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow from data preparation to prediction
2. Create reusable code that can be adapted for different datasets
3. Establish a baseline model for future improvements

##  Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
- Sample dataset of 10 houses with 3 features and 1 target variable
- Features: Size (sqft), Rooms (count), Location (categorical)
- Target: Price (USD)

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature Engineering**: Separation of features and target variable
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical location data
- **Data Splitting**: 80/20 train-test split for unbiased evaluation

### 3. **Model Selection**
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Rationale**: 
  - Simple, interpretable, and efficient
  - Well-suited for continuous numerical prediction
  - Good baseline for comparison with complex models

### 4. **Model Training**
- Training on 80% of the dataset (8 houses)
- Learning linear relationships between features and prices

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- **Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- **Validation**: Testing on unseen 20% of data (2 houses)
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot of actual vs predicted prices

### 6. **Prediction**
- Real-time prediction capability for new house data
- Example prediction included for demonstration

##  Limitations

### Current Limitations:
- **Small Dataset**: Only 10 houses may not capture full market complexity
- **Limited Features**: Only 3 features (size, rooms, location)
- **Simple Model**: Linear Regression assumes linear relationships
- **No Validation Set**: Only train-test split, no cross-validation
- **Static Data**: No real-time market data integration

### Assumptions:
- Linear relationship between features and price
- Location can be adequately represented by categorical encoding
- Sample data is representative of the broader market
- No significant outliers or data quality issues
